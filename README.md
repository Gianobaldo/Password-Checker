# Password-Checker

This project uses the Havebeenpwned API

This is a project that checks how many times a password has been hacked. It is more secure than typing passwords in a browse, since you are not sending a password through plain text through a website. Although Havebeenpwned site does hashes the password before sending it (which is also safe), with this script you add a sense of security because you are doing it locally not relying on the browser, website and the scripts.
